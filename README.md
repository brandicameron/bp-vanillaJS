## Description

---

This was my first project to include a realtime database as well as authentication, and Firebase (üôåüèª ) made it WAY less scary than I anticipated.

With this project I was able to work on:

- CRUD using a realtime database.
- Authentication including a guest login option.
- Dealing with edge cases. (e.g., incorrect password, insufficient password length on sign up, input focus that automatically jumps to the next input when entering reading data, notice that shows only if no readings have been added yet.)
- Creating a "slide to delete" button that functions on desktop or mobile.
- Using setTimeout.
