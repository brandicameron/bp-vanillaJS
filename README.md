Logo was created in Illustrator using monster vector graphics from [www.freepick.com](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/monster-character-set_1538770.htm#page=1&query=monsters&position=28)

Discovered the fisher-yates shuffle from this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array) post, which has been useful in other projects as well. (check out this [US Map Quiz](https://brandicameron.github.io/us-map-quiz/)!) ðŸ˜ƒ
